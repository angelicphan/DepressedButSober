## About

Depressed But Sober

### Releases

This is a mobile drinking card game app for iOS. There is a free
Android version currently released on Google Play. It is not
released on the Apple App Store because the concept of the game
goes against their Guideline 1.4.3 - Safety - Physical Harm, in
that it has excessive promotion of consuming alcohol (because it
is a drinking game). Meant for release in the U.S.A only as support
resources mentioned in the game are only local to the U.S..

### Ideation

This was created as a way for me to try out mobile app development
for iOS apps on Xcode (and Android apps on Android Studio). The
concept of the game is inspired by the drinking card game AZN Flush,
as well as the feelings that we may all have sometimes on our low
days. It's all light hearted though, and nothing too deep or dark.
It's meant to be a funny, dumb game for people to play together. I
don't even like drinking all that much, and it's meant to bring
awareness that alcohol should'nt be abused as a way for us to escape
and ignore our issues.

### The Spiel

A party game with friends and family that is meant to bring comedic
and emotional relief.

WARNING: This app may include content that are uncomfortable for some
audiences.

Despite the name of the game, depression isn't just feeling sad for
a few days. The game strives to bring to light and provide an
opportunity for us to reveal our concerns and to stand together in
solidarity as we relate to each other.

Whether the group decides to laugh and make light of everyone's
issues together, or take the time to reflect and give each other
support, it's up to you guys. However, please respect each other's
concerns rather than use it against one another.

This game also wants to raise awareness that alcohol shouldn't be
abused as a way for us to escape and ignore our issues. Please drink
responsibly.

## Tools

The application runs on Xcode.
